Naval Game in progress  
This is my first project. And I am trying at this point to create classes for my future naval game.  
<b> About Prefixes</b>:  
I've decided to add prefixes to class names. <b>W</b> is going to Warships, <b>G</b> to Guns.  
At this point Country prefixes are taken from ISO 3166-1.
